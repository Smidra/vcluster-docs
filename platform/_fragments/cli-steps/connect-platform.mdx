**Connect to the Platform**: In order to use any `vcluster platform` command, you need to be connected to the platform. 

When you started the platform, you would have automatically connected to the platform when you ran `vcluster platform start`. 

If you aren't sure if you are connected and already have a running platform, then you can login:

```
vcluster login
```
